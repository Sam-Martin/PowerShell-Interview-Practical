# PowerShell Practical Interview
This repository contains two practical PowerShell tests. One a [pre-interview test](PreInterviewQuestions.md), the other an [in person test](BasicQuestions.md) with basic questions. 

# Pre-interview Test
The pre-interview test has no time limit, and should be completed to the highest standard possible as this will factor into the selection process.

# Basic PowerShell 
The basic PowerShell test will be administered in person during the face-to-face interview process, and will be timeboxed to 45 minutes.
